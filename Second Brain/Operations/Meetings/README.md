# Meetings

Meeting notes are stored here.

Use your own meeting template and store it in `.github/skills/` or your template system.

## Structure

Each meeting note includes:
- Date, attendees, and project
- Agenda
- Discussion notes
- Action items with assignees
- Links and attachments
- Next steps

## Tips

- Create the meeting note before the meeting with the agenda
- Add action items with `- [ ] @person - task` format
- Link to project notes with `[[project-name]]`
- Use project tags like `#fenix` or `#neurohubs`
