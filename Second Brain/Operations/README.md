## Daily Notes

Daily notes are the backbone of Jointhubs. They capture:
- **Focus** — Weekly priorities embedded from `#Next`
- **Dziennik** — Journal entries (thoughts, mood, observations)
- **Logs** — Timestamped activity log
- **ToDo** — Tasks query grouped by priority

Use the `.github/skills/daily-log/template.md` template (copy it into your preferred template system).

## Weekly Notes

Weekly notes set priorities and aggregate daily journals:
- **Next** — 3-5 commitments for the week (gets embedded in daily notes)
- **History** — Embedded `#Dziennik` sections from each day
- **Tasks** — Completed and open tasks

Use the `.github/skills/weekly-review/template.md` template (copy it into your preferred template system).

## Meetings

Meeting notes capture:
- Agenda and attendees
- Discussion notes
- Action items
- Follow-up dates

Use your own meeting template and keep it with other templates in `.github/skills/` or your template system.
