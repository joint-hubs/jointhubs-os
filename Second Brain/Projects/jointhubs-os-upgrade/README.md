# Jointhubs OS Upgrade

> Applying Fenix patterns to jointhubs-os for project progression

## Overview

This project upgraded the jointhubs-os agent framework to introduce:
- Daily log as memory between sessions
- CONTEXT.md pattern for project state tracking
- Agent personalities with tone, reasoning, and quirks
- Directory-scoped instructions

## Status

✅ **Complete** — See [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) for full details.

## Quick Start

1. Start any conversation — agents will check the daily log first
2. Navigate to a project — agents will read CONTEXT.md
3. Work — agents update logs and context as you go
