# Weekly Review Skill

> How to conduct a comprehensive weekly review for Jointhubs

## When to Run

- **Ideal**: Sunday evening or Monday morning
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes
- **Energy**: Medium (not exhausted, not peak)

## Pre-Review Checklist

Before starting, gather:
- [ ] Access to Google Calendar (past week + next week)
- [ ] Access to daily notes from the week
- [ ] Google Tasks list
- [ ] Gmail (for action items hiding in inbox)

## Review Process

### Step 1: Capture Completions (5 min)

Ask: "What did I actually accomplish this week?"

**Data sources**:
- Google Calendar: completed meetings/events
- Daily notes: checked-off items
- Google Tasks: completed tasks
- Git commits (if relevant)

**Output**: List of 5-10 key accomplishments

### Step 2: Review Calendar Accuracy (5 min)

Compare what was planned vs what happened:

| Planned | Actual | Delta |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 8 meetings | 12 meetings | +4 (meeting creep) |
| 3 deep work blocks | 1 deep work block | -2 (interruptions) |
| 2 personal appointments | 2 personal | ✓ |

**Insight questions**:
- Did I protect my deep work time?
- What caused calendar deviations?
- Are recurring meetings still valuable?

### Step 3: Energy Pattern Analysis (5 min)

Review daily notes for energy markers:

```
Monday: #energy/high in AM, crashed by 3pm
Tuesday: Low all day (poor sleep)
Wednesday: Steady medium
Thursday: High energy, very productive
Friday: Coasting, low-stakes work only
```

**Insight questions**:
- What days/times am I most productive?
- What depletes my energy?
- Am I scheduling hard work at peak times?

### Step 4: Identify Patterns (10 min)

Look for recurring themes across the week:

**Positive patterns**:
- "When I start with hardest task, whole day goes better"
- "Morning walks correlate with higher energy"
- "Days with <3 meetings are most productive"

**Negative patterns**:
- "Context switching killed my focus every afternoon"
- "Skipping lunch leads to 3pm crash"
- "Late-night work = bad next morning"

### Step 5: Process Incomplete Items (5 min)

For each unfinished task, decide:
- **Do it next week**: Add to next week's priorities
- **Delegate it**: Assign to someone else
- **Defer it**: Move to someday/maybe
- **Delete it**: Remove (it's not important)

### Step 6: Plan Next Week (10 min)

Based on the review:

1. **Set the theme**: What's the main focus?
2. **Identify top 3 priorities**: Must-complete items
3. **Block time**: 
   - Deep work sessions
   - Buffer time for unexpected
   - Recovery/rest periods
4. **Pre-schedule low-energy tasks**: For predicted low days
