# Skills

Domain knowledge files that agents reference to understand your system.

## Files

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `obsidian-vault.md` | Vault structure, file paths, naming conventions |

| `weekly-review.md` | Weekly review process and prompts |
| `goal-tracking.md` | Goal setting and progress tracking |
| `discord-integration.md` | Discord bot setup and usage |

## Adding New Skills

Create a new `.md` file describing:
1. What the skill is for
2. Key concepts and terminology
3. How agents should use this knowledge

Then reference it in the agent's `applyTo` section.
