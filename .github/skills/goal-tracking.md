# Goal Tracking Skill

> How to set, track, and achieve goals with Jointhubs

## Goal Hierarchy

### Vision (1-5 years)
Big picture aspirations. Not specific, but directional.
- Example: "Build a sustainable solo business"
- Review: Annually

### Goals (Quarterly)
Measurable outcomes. Specific and time-bound.
- Example: "Launch MVP and get 10 paying users by March 31"
- Review: Weekly (quick), Monthly (deep)

### Projects (Weekly-Monthly)
Concrete work that moves toward goals.
- Example: "Build user authentication system"
- Review: Weekly

### Tasks (Daily)
Individual actions.
- Example: "Write login API endpoint"
- Review: Daily

## Setting Effective Goals

### The Focus-Friendly Goal Formula

Traditional SMART goals can feel restrictive. Use this instead:

**Exciting + Specific + Flexible**

| Element | What it means | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Exciting | You actually WANT it | "Build a product people love" not "increase revenue" |
| Specific | Clear success criteria | "10 paying users" not "some users" |
| Flexible | Adaptable path | "By end of Q1" with weekly check-ins |

### Goal Limit

- **Maximum 3 quarterly goals** (1-2 is better)
- **One theme per quarter** to maintain focus

### Write Goals as Questions

Instead of: "Launch MVP by March"
Try: "How might I get 10 people to pay for my product by March?"

Questions activate curiosity and problem-solving.

## Tracking Progress

### Weekly Goal Check-in (5 min)

Every weekly review, answer:

1. **What moved forward?** (Progress, not completion)
2. **What's stuck?** (Blockers or avoidance?)
3. **Next week's focus?** (1-2 concrete actions)

### Monthly Goal Review (30 min)

Deeper assessment:

1. **On track?** Rate 1-5 for each goal
2. **What's working?** What strategies/habits are helping?
3. **What's not?** What needs to change?
4. **Adjust?** Modify goal, timeline, or approach if needed

### Progress Indicators

Track leading indicators (actions) not just lagging indicators (results):

| Goal | Lagging (result) | Leading (actions) |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| Get 10 users | User count | Demos given, landing page views |
| Write book | Word count | Writing sessions per week |
| Get fit | Weight/measurements | Workouts completed |

## Common Goal Pitfalls

### 1. Too Many Goals
**Problem**: Scattered attention, nothing finishes
**Fix**: Maximum 3 quarterly goals, ideally 1-2

### 2. Vague Goals
**Problem**: No clear success criteria
**Fix**: Add specific numbers and dates

### 3. All-or-Nothing Thinking
**Problem**: Miss one week = give up entirely
**Fix**: Track streaks AND recovery. "I did 3 out of 4 weeks" is success.

### 4. No Review Cadence
**Problem**: Set and forget
**Fix**: Weekly micro-review, monthly deep review

### 5. Goals vs Systems Confusion
**Problem**: Focusing on outcome, not process
**Fix**: "I will write for 30 min daily" > "I will write a book"

## Integration with Agents

### Planner Agent
- Reference current goals when prioritizing tasks
- Flag when daily tasks don't connect to any goal
- Suggest goal-aligned tasks during planning

### Journal Agent
- Track goal-related wins
- Note energy patterns around goal work
- Celebrate progress, not just completion

### Review Agent
- Pull goal progress into weekly reviews
- Compare current week to goal milestones
- Flag goals that haven't had activity in 2+ weeks

2. Check progress log
3. Calculate % to target
4. Suggest next actions

### Milestone Check
Ask: "Am I on track for [milestone]?"

Agent will:
1. Check milestone date
2. Calculate required pace
3. Compare to actual pace
4. Recommend adjustments

### Goal Alignment
Ask: "Does [task] connect to my goals?"

Agent will:
1. Identify current goals
2. Check if task is in milestone breakdown
3. Flag if orphan task (no goal connection)
