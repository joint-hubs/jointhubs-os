# Focus Support

Strategies for maintaining focus and working with your natural patterns.

## When to Use

- Starting a focus session
- Struggling to concentrate
- Planning deep work blocks
- Managing energy

## Core Principles

1. **Work WITH your brain** — Optimize for how you actually work
2. **External scaffolding** — Systems over willpower
3. **Interest-based motivation** — Interest, urgency, novelty, challenge

## Quick Techniques

| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| 2-minute start | Can't begin |
| Pomodoro (25/5) | Need structure |
| Body doubling | Low motivation |
| Location change | Stuck on problem |
| Brown noise | Easily distracted |

## Focus Session Flow

### Start
1. Clear workspace
2. Define ONE outcome
3. Set timer (25-50 min)
4. Put phone away

### During
- If distracted: note it, return
- If stuck: change approach or take break
- If flowing: extend the session

### End
1. Note what was accomplished
2. Capture next action
3. Take real break (not phone)

## Calendar Blocks

Use: `🎯 Deep Work: {topic}`

Set as **Busy** to protect the time.

## Agent Integration

DeepWork agent facilitates focus sessions:
- Clarifies the goal
- Protects from distractions
- Tracks progress

## Energy Patterns

Track when you're naturally UP vs DOWN:
- Peak hours → hard creative work
- Low hours → admin, email, routine

Schedule accordingly.
