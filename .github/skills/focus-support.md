# Focus Support Skill

> Strategies for maintaining focus, managing energy, and working with your natural patterns

## Core Principles

### 1. Work WITH your brain, not against it
Everyone's brain works differently. These strategies optimize for how your brain actually works.

### 2. External scaffolding over internal willpower
Don't rely on "trying harder." Build systems, use tools, create accountability.

### 3. Interest-based motivation
Most people work best with interest, urgency, novelty, and challenge—not abstract importance.

## Daily Strategies

### Morning Activation

**The Problem**: Hard to start, executive function is low

**Solutions**:
- [ ] One tiny action first (make bed, drink water)
- [ ] Body doubling: Start a focus session on Focusmate or Discord
- [ ] Pre-decide the first task the night before
- [ ] Use a "launch ritual" (same music, same coffee, same spot)

### Task Initiation

**The Problem**: Can't start even when you want to

**Techniques**:
| Technique | How it works |
|-----------|--------------|
| 2-minute start | Commit to just 2 minutes, then decide to continue |
| Body doubling | Work alongside someone (virtual or in-person) |
| Temptation bundling | Pair boring task with something enjoyable |
| Artificial urgency | Set a timer, pretend deadline is sooner |
| Shrink the task | "I'll just open the file" not "I'll finish the report" |

### Maintaining Focus

**The Problem**: Attention drifts, especially for boring tasks

**Techniques**:
- Pomodoro (25/5) or shorter intervals (15/3)
- Background music/noise (brown noise, lo-fi, video game soundtracks)
- Fidget tools while on calls
- Standing desk or walking while thinking
- Change locations mid-task for novelty

### Managing Energy

**The Problem**: Energy is inconsistent and unpredictable

**Strategies**:
- Track energy patterns (when are you naturally UP vs DOWN?)
- Schedule hard tasks for peak energy times
- Keep a "low-energy task list" for crash periods
- Don't fight the crash—do easy wins instead
- Movement breaks to reset energy

## Weekly Strategies

### Planning

**The Problem**: Traditional planning doesn't account for energy fluctuations

**Adapted approach**:
1. **Theme the week**, don't over-schedule
2. **Maximum 3 priorities** per day (1 is better)
3. **Buffer time** between everything (30% of calendar should be empty)
4. **Pre-assign low-energy tasks** to predictable low-energy times
5. **Build in rewards** after hard tasks

### Time Blindness

**The Problem**: No sense of how long things take or what time it is

**Accommodations**:
- Time blocking with VISUAL calendars
- Timers always running (Time Timer, phone timer)
- Alarms for transitions (not just events)
- "Departure alarms" 30 min before you need to leave
- Weekly time audit: estimate vs actual

### Procrastination Cycles

**The Problem**: Avoiding → guilt → more avoiding

**Breaking the cycle**:
1. Recognize: "I'm avoiding this"
2. Get curious: "What specifically feels hard?"
3. Shrink: "What's the tiniest next step?"
4. Start ugly: Give permission for imperfect first draft
5. Reward: Celebrate starting, not just finishing

## Low-Energy Mode

When everything feels impossible:

### Recognize the Signs
- Can't make decisions
- Everything feels overwhelming
- Physical heaviness
- Irritability or emotional sensitivity

### Low-Energy Toolkit

**Do**:
- [ ] Drink water
- [ ] Eat something (protein helps)
- [ ] Move for 5 minutes
- [ ] Step outside briefly
- [ ] Do one tiny task (reply to one email)

**Don't**:
- Make big decisions
- Schedule difficult conversations
- Start complex projects
- Beat yourself up

### Low-Energy Tasks

Keep this list ready for crash moments:
- Organize digital files
- Unsubscribe from emails
- Update software
- Clean physical workspace (small area)
- Watch tutorial videos for work
- Reply to non-urgent messages
- Review and close browser tabs

## Emotional Regulation

### Rejection Sensitivity

**The Problem**: Perceived criticism feels devastating

**Strategies**:
- Pause before responding (sleep on it if possible)
- Write response, don't send immediately
- Reality check: "What would I tell a friend in this situation?"
- Build evidence folder: Save positive feedback to review when spiraling

### Overwhelm

**The Problem**: Everything piles up until meltdown

**Prevention**:
- Weekly reviews to catch accumulation
- Regular inbox/task purges
- Permission to say no/delegate
- Recognize early warning signs

**During overwhelm**:
1. Stop everything
2. Write down what's in your head (brain dump)
3. Pick ONE thing to do next
4. Do only that thing
5. Repeat

### Hyperfocus Recovery

**The Problem**: Hyperfocus feels productive but leads to burnout

**Strategies**:
- Set alarms even during flow states
- Schedule meals/breaks non-negotiably
- Use hyperfocus for important work, not rabbit holes
- Plan recovery time after intense focus periods

## Communication Scripts

### When you need more time
> "I want to give this proper attention. Can I get back to you by [specific date]?"

### When you missed something
> "I apologize for the delay. Here's where I'm at and what I need to finish this: [specifics]"

### When you're overwhelmed
> "I'm at capacity right now. Can we discuss prioritization?"

### When asking for accommodations
> "I work best when I have [specific accommodation]. Would it be possible to [request]?"

## Agent Integration

### Planner Agent should:
- Default to 3 tasks max per day
- Always include buffer time
- Suggest task-reward pairings
- Identify energy requirements for tasks

### Journal Agent should:
- Celebrate small wins enthusiastically
- Not guilt-trip about incomplete tasks
- Suggest breaks when detecting overload
- Track energy patterns over time

### Review Agent should:
- Frame struggles as data, not failures
- Highlight patterns without judgment
- Keep reviews short and actionable
- Compare to own past, not others' standards

## Quick Reference Card

### Starting is hard?
→ 2-minute timer, just begin

### Can't focus?
→ Change location, add music, set timer

### Overwhelmed?
→ Brain dump, pick ONE thing

### Crashing?
→ Water, food, movement, tiny task

### Avoiding something?
→ Shrink it, start ugly, reward yourself

### Hyperfocusing?
→ Set alarm, schedule break, recovery time after
