# Agents

VS Code Copilot agent definitions. Each agent has a specialized role:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `planner` | Daily/weekly planning, schedule optimization |
| `journal` | Pattern recognition, reflection, habit tracking |
| `review` | End-of-week synthesis and insights |
| `inbox` | Email triage, meeting prep, task extraction |
| `deepwork` | Focused work sessions with minimal distractions |

## Usage

In VS Code Copilot Chat, select an agent from the dropdown or type `@agent-name`.

## Customization

Edit the agent files to adjust personality, add tools, or change handoff behavior.
